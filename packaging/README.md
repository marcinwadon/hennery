# Release builds

What a hennery release would ship is built by the `build` workflow
(`.github/workflows/build.yml`) on every pull request and every push to
`main` (distribution spec §2, plan 7a). It is checked, then kept as workflow
artifacts for a week. **Nothing is published:** there are no releases yet.

| Artifact | Built by | Checked by |
|---|---|---|
| `hennery-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.xz`, `hennery-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.xz` | `dist build`, natively on each architecture, with `musl-gcc` | `check-archive.sh` (the binary, its licence and README, nothing else); `check-linkage.sh` (no shared library, no loader); runs on the runner and on Alpine |
| `hennery-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz` | `dist build` on macOS arm64 | `check-archive.sh`; `check-linkage.sh` (system libraries only); runs |
| `hennery-installer.sh` | `dist build --artifacts=global`, then `harden-installer.py` | `test-installer.sh`, on Linux x86_64 and on macOS |
| `hennery.rb` (Homebrew formula) | `dist build --artifacts=global` | `check-formula.sh` |
| `sha256.sum` | `dist build --artifacts=global` | — |
| the collector image, one architecture per Linux runner | `docker build` of `Dockerfile` on the staged musl binary | `smoke-image.sh` |

Every archive builds with the `vendored-openssl` feature
(`dist-workspace.toml`). OpenSSL, which `webauthn-rs-core` links, is then
compiled in from source. Without it, the macOS binary would load Homebrew's
`libssl` and fail on a Mac without it, and a static musl build would not
link at all (distribution §1.1). Development and `ci.yml` use the system
OpenSSL.

Third-party actions are pinned by commit, every image by its multi-arch
digest, and cargo-dist by the SHA-256 in `install-dist.sh`.

## OpenSSL

The release binaries carry their own OpenSSL: 3.6.3, from `openssl-src`
300.6.1+3.6.3 in `Cargo.lock`. Updating the system's OpenSSL does not
reach them. An OpenSSL fix reaches users only when `openssl-src` is bumped
in `Cargo.lock` and a new release is made. `webauthn-rs` passes what a
browser sends (attestation and assertion data) through it, so OpenSSL's
advisories are this project's to follow.

OpenSSL 3.6 is not a long-term-support line. Check its end of support
against openssl.org's release strategy before the first release, and move
to a supported line if it ends first.

## Locally

The dev shell's toolchain links Nix's `libiconv` on macOS, so a local
release build is for trying out, not for handing on; `check-linkage.sh` says
so. Linux archives and the image are built in CI only.

```sh
nix develop -c cargo build --profile dist -p hennery --features vendored-openssl
sh packaging/check-linkage.sh target/dist/hennery
```

## Publishing is the operator's

These need the operator's decision, credentials, or both. None is set up:

- **GitHub Releases.** `dist generate` writes a `release.yml` that builds the
  same archives and creates a release on every version tag. It is not
  committed (`allow-dirty = ["ci"]` in `dist-workspace.toml`). Committed, it
  must:
  - keep this workflow's checks: `check-archive.sh`, `check-linkage.sh`,
    `test-installer.sh`, `check-formula.sh`;
  - run `harden-installer.py` before the installer is uploaded, and before
    it is attested;
  - pin every action by commit;
  - restore no Actions cache (no `rust-cache`), since anything a `main`
    workflow runs can write one;
  - build with a pinned toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`).

  The `build` workflow's artifacts are never promoted to a release: a pull
  request's are built from code nobody has reviewed yet.
- **Artifact attestations** (`github-attestations = true`): they need
  `id-token: write` and `attestations: write`, and they write to the public
  Sigstore log. The README's "verified install" (`gh attestation verify
  hennery-installer.sh --repo marcinwadon/hennery`) is documented with the
  first release.
- **The Homebrew tap** (`marcinwadon/homebrew-tap`): the repository and a
  token allowed to push to it.
- **The image on GHCR:** `packages: write`, one multi-arch manifest from
  the per-architecture images, and its provenance attestation. Its docs
  should say: publish the port on loopback behind a TLS proxy
  (`-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080`); read the setup link with
  `docker exec … hennery admin setup-url`, not from `docker logs` (with
  `docker run -t` the link itself is logged); a bind mount keeps the host's
  owner, so it must belong to 65532; change the port with `HENNERY_LISTEN`,
  not `--listen` on the command, because the `HEALTHCHECK` reads
  `HENNERY_LISTEN`.
- **Third-party licence notices:** the archives carry only hennery's
  `LICENSE`, and the image none. Before the first release, generate the
  notices for the Rust crates and the vendored OpenSSL (Apache-2.0), e.g.
  with `cargo-about`; ship them in each archive and in the image; and
  update `check-archive.sh`'s exact list and the `.dockerignore`.
- **Dependency updates** (Dependabot, or another bot): for `openssl-src`
  above all, the pinned actions and the image digests. It opens pull
  requests on its own schedule, so it is the operator's to switch on.
- **Fork pull requests:** require approval before their workflows run.
